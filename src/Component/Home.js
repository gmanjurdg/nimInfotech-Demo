            <p> Python
            This may surprise you; I have kept python on number #2, in many of the surveys 
            it is positioned on number #5. But, I will definitely let you believe, here’s why?
            Python is one of the general purpose, user-friendly programming language here on my 
            list. What makes it so? Like Java, Python syntax is clear, intuitive and almost similar to 
            the English language. Python’s “object-based” subset is somewhere similar to JavaScript.
            According to Stack Overflow, there is one section which says “To be adopted or migrated to 
            be—or to migrate too soon”, and for python, it’s 12% which is highest. Broadly, people who 
            have migrated to python are close to 42%, which signifies it to be at number.</p>
