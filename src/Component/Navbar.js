                    is a tool that is ours to control. Files and documents, especially those in open 
                    standard formats, can be manipulated using a variety of software tools, not just one 
                    specific piece of software. A programming language is a tool that allows us to manipulate 
                    data stored in files and to manipulate 
                    data held in RAM in unlimited ways. Even with a basic knowledge of programming, we can 
                    perform a huge variety of data processing tasks.</p>
